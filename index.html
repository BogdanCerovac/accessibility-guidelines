    <h1>Accessibility Guidelines Summary</h1>

    <p>
      This document will help you quickly get up to speed with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1</a>, and avoid common accessibility mistakes.
      It covers <span class="badge badge--level-A"></span> and <span class="badge badge--level-AA"></span> requirements.
    </p>

    <p>All guidelines, except three, apply to native apps as well as websites and web apps. The three exceptions are marked <span class="badge badge--web-only"></span>.</p>

    <p>This summary is a simplification. If you're not sure whether a guideline applies, check the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">official W3C document</a>.</p>


    <section aria-labelledby="principle_1_header">
      <h2 id="principle_1_header">1. Easy to perceive</h2>

      <p>Your website/app must present information in ways that people can recognise and use, no matter how they consume content (for example if they have low vision, or use assistive technologies like screen readers).</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="./guidelines/1.1.1.html">Text alternatives for images</a>.

        <li>
          <a href="./guidelines/1.2.1.html">Transcript (for prerecorded audio-only content)</a>.
          For audio content that has no video (like a podcast), provide a transcript.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="./guidelines/1.3.1.html">Structure and relationships</a>.
          When designs convey a structure visually (like distinct sections within a page, or a label next to a checkbox) that structure must also be identified in code.
          <br/>
          <span class="badge badge--level-A"></span>
          <span class="badge badge--design"></span>

          <span class="badge badge--design"></span>

        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="./guidelines/1.3.3.html">Instructions don't rely on sensory characteristics</a>.
          When giving guidance or instructions, don't assume that users can perceive colour, size, shape, sound or the location of elements on screen.
          <br/>
          <span class="badge badge--level-A"></span>
          <span class="badge badge--design"></span>

          <span class="badge badge--design"></span>

        <li>
          <a href="./guidelines/1.3.5.html">Purpose of text fields</a>.
          If a text input field collects information about the user, identify its specific purpose in code (e.g. email, password, street address).
          <br/>
          <span class="badge badge--level-AA"></span>

      <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="./guidelines/1.4.1.html">Use of colour</a>.
            Do not use colour as the only way to convey any piece of information.
            <br/>
            <span class="badge badge--level-A"></span>
            <span class="badge badge--design"></span>

            <a href="./guidelines/1.4.2.html">Audio control</a>.

            <span class="badge badge--level-A"></span>
            <span class="badge badge--design"></span>

            <span class="badge badge--design"></span>
          </li>

          <li>
            <a href="./guidelines/1.4.11.html">Non-text contrast</a>.
            Make sure that visual information that identifies important graphics, interactive controls and their state has enough contrast against adjacent colours.
            <br/>
            <span class="badge badge--level-AA"></span>
            <span class="badge badge--design"></span>

          <li>
            <a href="./guidelines/1.4.4.html">Resize text</a>.
            Make sure it is possible to complete all tasks when text is resized up to 200%.

          </li>

          <li>
            <a href="./guidelines/1.4.10.html">Reflow</a>.
            Make sure users can access all information and functionality on a screen that's as wide as on the iPhone5, without needing to scroll in both directions.
            <br/>
            <span class="badge badge--level-AA"></span>
            <span class="badge badge--design"></span>

          <li>
            <a href="./guidelines/1.4.12.html">Text spacing</a>.
            Ensure that no information or functionality gets lost if users increase the space between lines, paragraphs, letters and words.
            <br/>
            <span class="badge badge--level-AA"></span>
            <span class="badge badge--design"></span>

          <li>
            <a href="./guidelines/1.4.5.html">Images of text</a>.

          <li>
            <a href="./guidelines/1.4.13.html">Extra content on hover or focus</a>.
            If content (like a tooltip) appears when users hover over an element with their mouse (or tab to it with their keyboard), it must be easy to dismiss, easy to reach and remain visible.
            <br/>

    <section aria-labelledby="principle_2_header">
      <h2 id="principle_2_header">2. Easy to operate</h2>

      <p>Your website/app must be easy to navigate and use, no matter how someone interacts with it.</p>

      <p>For example people who don't use a mouse may use their voice, or press the 'Tab' key to move their keyboard's focus to interactive controls.</p>

      <h3>2.1. Make all functionality work with a keyboard</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="">Keyboard</a>.

          <span class="badge badge--design"></span>

        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="">Keyboard shortcuts</a>

          <span class="badge badge--design"></span>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="">Timing adjustable</a>.

        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="">Focus order</a>.

          <span class="badge badge--design"></span>

        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="">Link purpose</a>.
          Make sure the purpose of every link is clear from the link text alone, or together with associated content (if screen readers recognise the association).
          <br/>
          <span class="badge badge--level-A"></span>
          <span class="badge badge--design"></span>

        <li>
          <a href="">Multiple ways to find a page</a>.
          Give people different ways of finding each page (like searching or browsing links), unless the page is a step in a process.

        <li>
          <a href="">Focus visible</a>.

          <span class="badge badge--design"></span>
          <span class="badge badge--engineering"></span>
        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="">Heading and labels</a>.
          Provide headings and form labels that help people find content and complete tasks.

        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="">Touch or click activation</a>.
          Make sure that custom buttons or links do not activate as soon as they are touched, so that users can slide their finger or mouse away to cancel the action.
          <br/>
          <span class="badge badge--level-AA"></span>
          <span class="badge badge--engineering"></span>
        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="">Label in name</a>.
          When an interactive control has a name on screen, make sure that assistive technologies (like Voice Control) know it by the same name (or a name that includes the name on screen).
          <br/>
          <span class="badge badge--level-AA"></span>

        <li>
          <a href="">Device motion</a>.
          If a feature uses the device's motion (like shaking or tilting), make sure that responses to these motions can be turned off, and that the feature can be used in another way.

      <h3>3.1. Make text easy to understand</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="">Language of page</a>.
          In code, identify the language that the content of the page is written in (English for example).

        <li>
          <a href="">Changes on input</a>.
          Make sure that just changing the state of a form input (like a checkbox) does not cause anything surprising to happen (like submitting a form, or automatically moving the keyboard focus).

          <span class="badge badge--level-A"></span>
