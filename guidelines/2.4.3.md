## Summary

**Make sure that interactive controls receive focus in an order that makes sense, when users navigate through them with the keyboard.**

It must be possible to navigate through content in a way that makes sense.

---

## Requirements

* When navigated sequentially using a keyboard, interactive elements receive [focus](./definitions.md#keyboard-focus) following a predictable, natural reading order (from left to right and top to bottom, in most cases).
* The easiest way to avoid focus order issues is to make sure that elements are displayed on screen in the same order as they appear in the DOM (Web) / Outline View (iOS and Android).

### Why?

This ensures that content can be navigated in a logical way by screen reader users, keyboard users and Switch device users.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**2.4.3 Focus Order:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-focus-order.html) If a [Web page](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-focus-order.html#webpagedef) can be [navigated sequentially](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-focus-order.html#nav-seqdef) and the navigation sequences affect meaning or operation, focusable components receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and operability. (Level A)

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-focus-order.html) with techniques and examples.

## Guidance for Design

* When you provide different mock-ups for different screen sizes (e.g. desktop and mobile, or for different break points), make sure that all interactive elements appear in the same order across on the different mock-ups.
* On the mock-ups that you give to developers or in conversations, indicate what the expected content order is (especially for interactive elements).

### Common mistakes

* Imagine that you have a dialog has two buttons: 'Cancel' and 'OK'.
  * On the design for large screens, the 'Cancel' button it is positioned to the left of the 'OK' button (so it comes first in the reading order).
  * But on the design for small screens, the 'Cancel' button is positioned to the bottom of the 'OK' button (so it comes second).
* The order or navigation links is not consistent across designs for different screen sizes

## Guidance for Web

* Do not use positive values with `tabindex`;
* With CSS Flexbox, don't use the `order` property or `flex-direction: reverse;`;
* With CSS Grid, be careful with manual placement of items on the grid;
* When using `position` `absolute`, `fixed` or `sticky`, be careful to not detach the visual order of elements from the order in which they appear in the DOM;
* If a button triggers extra content to appear (like a menu), make sure that that extra content appears next to the button in both the DOM order and visual order.

### Common mistakes

* The DOM order does not match the visual order because CSS properties like flexbox and grid-layout have been used to alter the visual presentation;
* The DOM order does not match the visual order because `tabindex` has been used with a value other than `-1` or `0`.
* A 'Agree to cookies' dialog that's positioned last in the DOM but appears at the top of the screen, without being implemented as modal (with the `inert` attribute)
* When CSS styles are disabled, the focus order is meaningless;
* Using dialogs or menus that are not adjacent to their trigger control in the sequential navigation order.
