### Tab order

All interactive elements on a page/screen should be reachable by users using the 'tab' key on their keyboard. 
When users press the 'tab' key once, they reach the first interactive element on the page. When they press the 'tab' key again they reach the second focusable element, and so on.

The **tab order** (also known as 'visual focus order' or 'keyboard focus order') is the order in which interactive elements appear, when users press 'tab' repeatedly.

### Keyboard focus

All interactive elements on a page/screen should be reachable by users using the 'tab' key on their keyboard. 
When users press the 'tab' key once, they reach the first interactive element on the page. When they press the 'tab' key again they reach the second focusable element, and so on.

The position of the 'keyboard focus' is the interactive element on the page that has last been reached using the 'tab' key. That element is the one that will respond to keyboard events (for example, selecting a radio button, visiting a link or inputting test in an input field).
