### 'tab order'

All interactive elements on a page/screen should be reachable by users using the 'tab' key on their keyboard. 
When users press the 'tab' key once, they reach the first interactive element on the page. When they press the 'tab' key again they reach the second focusable element, and so on.

the **tab order** is the order in which interactive elements appear, when users press 'tab' repeatedly.
