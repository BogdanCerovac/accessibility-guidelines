## Summary

**When someone makes an error while filling a form, describe the error in text and clearly identify where the error is.**

When a form validation error occurs, the user is informed of what caused the error, and the error is described in text.

---

## Requirements

*   Each form validation error is described in text;
*   Each form validation error is associated with the input field it relates to;

### Common mistakes

*   An error is only indicated by an icon near to the field;
*   An error is described in text, but it is not associated in code with the field it relates to.

### Why?

This ensures that the form validation error is available to people who cannot see, distinguish colours, or understand icons and other visual cues.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**3.3.1 Error Identification:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-programmatic.html) If an [input error](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/minimize-error-identified.html#input-errordef) is automatically detected, the item that is in error is identified and the error is described to the user in text. (Level A)

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-programmatic.html) with techniques and examples.

## Guidance for Web

### Associating an error with a text input field using `aria-describedby`

```html
<label for="national-insurance-number">
  National Insurance number
</label>

<span id="national-insurance-number-hint">
  It’s on your National Insurance card, benefit letter, payslip or P60. For example, ‘QQ 12 34 56 C’.
</span>

<input id="national-insurance-number" name="national-insurance-number" type="text"
aria-describedby="national-insurance-number-hint national-insurance-number-error">

<span id="national-insurance-number-error">
  <span class="visually-hidden">Error:</span> Enter a National Insurance number in the correct format
</span>
```
