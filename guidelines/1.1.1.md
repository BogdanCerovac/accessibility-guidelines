## Summary

**Provide an alternative text description for images. Make sure the description conveys the same message or functionality.**

All non-text content (like images, charts, icons and infographics) must have an appropriate text equivalent.

---

## Requirements

* Images (like logos and icons) that communicate information have short text descriptions.
* Editorial images that support the text around them have short descriptions.
* Images (like infographics, charts and diagrams) that communicate complex information also have longer text descriptions within the same page.
* Images that are purely decorative (i.e. that do not convey any information) have empty text descriptions and are not read out by screen readers.

### Why?

This ensures that information conveyed by non-text content is available to people who cannot see it, like screen reader users.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**1.1.1 Non-text Content:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html) All [non-text content](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html#non-text-contentdef) that is presented to the user has a [text alternative](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html#text-altdef) that serves the equivalent purpose, except for the situations listed below. (Level A)
>
> * **Controls, Input**: If non-text content is a control or accepts user input, then it has a [name](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html#namedef) that describes its purpose.
>
>* **Time-Based Media**: If non-text content is time-based media, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.
>
>* **Test**: If non-text content is a test or exercise that would be invalid if presented in [text](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html#textdef), then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.
>
>* **Sensory**: If non-text content is primarily intended to create a [specific sensory experience](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html#sensoryexpdef), then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.
>
>* **CAPTCHA**: If the purpose of non-text content is to confirm that content is being accessed by a person rather than a computer, then text alternatives that identify and describe the purpose of the non-text content are provided, and alternative forms of [CAPTCHA](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html#CAPTCHAdef) using output modes for different types of sensory perception are provided to accommodate different disabilities.
>
>* **Decoration, Formatting, Invisible**: If non-text content is [pure decoration](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html#puredecdef), is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users, then it is implemented in a way that it can be ignored by [assistive technology](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html#atdef).

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html) with techniques and examples.

## Guidance for iOS

### Giving a *non-decorative* `UIImageView` a label:

```swift
logoImageView.isAccessibilityElement = true
logoImageView.accessibilityLabel = "Company Name"
```

### Hiding a *decorative* `UIImageView` from screen readers:

```swift
decorativeImageView.isAccessibilityElement = false
```

### More guidance for iOS

---

## Guidance for Android

### Giving a **non-decorative** `ImageView` a label:

```kotlin
imageView.importantForAccessibility = IMPORTANT_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY_YES //optional, because all views that are focusable are important for accessibility
imageView.contentDescription = "Company Name"
```

```xml
android:contentDescription="Company Name"
```

### Hiding a **decorative** `ImageView` from screen readers:

```kotlin
imageView.importantForAccessibility = IMPORTANT_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY_NO
```
