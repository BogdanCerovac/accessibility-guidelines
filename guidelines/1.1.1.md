## Summary

**Provide an alternative text description for images. Make sure the description conveys the same message or functionality.**

All non-text content (like images, charts, icons and infographics) must have an appropriate text equivalent.

---

## Requirements

* Images (like logos and icons) that communicate information have short text descriptions that serve the same purpose as the image:
  * When the image conveys information (like an image that is part of a news article), the text description should convey the same information as the image.
  * When the purpose of the image is to convey a functionality (like a magnifying glass icon), the text description should convey that funtionality (like "search").

### Complex images

* Images (like infographics, charts and diagrams) that communicate complex information also have longer text descriptions within the same page.

### Purely decorative and redundant images

* Images that are purely decorative (i.e. that do not convey any information) should be explicitely silenced in code so that they are not read out by screen readers.

* Images that are completely redundant (i.e. that convey information or functionality that's already conveyed in text) should be explicitely silenced in code so that they are not read out by screen readers.
  * For example, if a magnifying glass icon is part of a button that has a visible label with the text "Search", the image itself shouldn't be read out by screen readers

### Common mistakes

* The image communicates information but does not have a text description;
* The text description does not communicate the same information as the image;
* The image has a text description that is an exact duplication of content elsewhere on the page.

### Why?

This ensures that information conveyed by non-text content is available to people who cannot see it, like screen reader users.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**1.1.1 Non-text Content:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html) All [non-text content](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html#non-text-contentdef) that is presented to the user has a [text alternative](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html#text-altdef) that serves the equivalent purpose, except for the situations listed below. (Level A)
>
> * **Controls, Input**: If non-text content is a control or accepts user input, then it has a [name](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html#namedef) that describes its purpose.
>
>* **Time-Based Media**: If non-text content is time-based media, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.
>
>* **Test**: If non-text content is a test or exercise that would be invalid if presented in [text](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html#textdef), then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.
>
>* **Sensory**: If non-text content is primarily intended to create a [specific sensory experience](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html#sensoryexpdef), then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.
>
>* **CAPTCHA**: If the purpose of non-text content is to confirm that content is being accessed by a person rather than a computer, then text alternatives that identify and describe the purpose of the non-text content are provided, and alternative forms of [CAPTCHA](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html#CAPTCHAdef) using output modes for different types of sensory perception are provided to accommodate different disabilities.
>
>* **Decoration, Formatting, Invisible**: If non-text content is [pure decoration](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html#puredecdef), is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users, then it is implemented in a way that it can be ignored by [assistive technology](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html#atdef).

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html) with techniques and examples.

## Guidance for Design

* Annotate your designs to tell developers what the text equivalent of images should be:
  * When the image conveys information (like an image that is part of a news article), the text description should convey the same information as the image.
  * When the purpose of the image is to convey a functionality (like a magnifying glass icon), the text description should convey that funtionality (like "search").
* Annotate your designs to tell developers which images should be 'silenced' (i.e. ignored by screen readers) because they are purely decorative or completely redundant.
* Make sure that charts, graphs, diagrams and other complex images are described in text on the same page or in a page linked from the page containing the image.
  * When charts or graphs are used to display tabular information (i.e. interrelated data), the same data is
shown in a correctly marked-up table.

## Guidance for iOS

### Giving a *non-decorative* `UIImageView` a label:

```swift
logoImageView.isAccessibilityElement = true
logoImageView.accessibilityLabel = "Company Name"
```

### Hiding a *decorative* `UIImageView` from screen readers:

```swift
decorativeImageView.isAccessibilityElement = false
```

### More guidance for iOS

* [UIAccessibility developer reference](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/accessibility/uiaccessibility)

---

## Guidance for Android

### Giving a **non-decorative** `ImageView` a label:

```kotlin
imageView.importantForAccessibility = IMPORTANT_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY_YES //optional, because all views that are focusable are important for accessibility
imageView.contentDescription = "Company Name"
```

```xml
android:contentDescription="Company Name"
```

### Hiding a **decorative** `ImageView` from screen readers:

```kotlin
imageView.importantForAccessibility = IMPORTANT_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY_NO
```

## Guidance for Web

### All HTML images should have the `alt` attribute in their source code

* If an `img` or `svg` element doesn't have an `alt` attribute, screen readers will read the file name of the image as it's name;
* If you need to 'silence' an image, give it `alt=""`.

### For images that convey information, the `alt` text should convey the same information

* A meaningful and accurate textual description should be provided for all informative images (i.e. images that convey important information).

### For images that convey functionality, the `alt` text should convey the same functionality

* A textual description of their function or destination content should be provided for all functional images (i.e. images that act as links or buttons).
* For example, a mignifying glass icon that triggers a search function should have `alt="Search"` (unless the image is accompanied by a "Search" text node, in which case the image should be silenced to avoid repetition).

### Do not indicate the type of the element in its `alt` text

* Textual descriptions do not need to communicate the type of element (e.g. “image of”, “button for” do not need to be included).

### Silence images that are purely decorative or completely redundant using `alt=""`

* Images that are purely decorative (i.e. images that have a solely decorative purpose) and images that are completely redundant (i.e. images whose meaning is already written in text) should have `alt=""`, or be CSS background images, so that they're ignored by screen readers.

### Do not use CSS `background-image` for images unless they're purely decorative or redundant

* Do not use a CSS `background-image` for images that convey purpose or information not already available in text. (CSS background images should only used for decorative images).
  * Here's why:
    * Background images are not available to assistive technology such as screen readers and are not supported on devices with minimal support for CSS.
    * Additionally, a background image may not load.
    * It is not possible to directly assign alternative text to a CSS background image. Another method must also be used to provide the same information visibly, and in a way that is programmatically determinable by assistive technology, such as screen readers.
