# Text alternative for images

## Provide alternative text for images.<br />Make sure it conveys the same message.

### In a nutshell

- Every image must ...
  - ... have a text equivalent that serves the same purpose,
    - if it conveys information or a functionality.
  - ... or be silenced,
    - if it doesn't convey any information,
    - or if the information it conveys is always available in text.

### This is so that ...

- People who use screen readers can perceive information conveyed via images.
- People who use speech input software can trigger buttons and links that include icons.

## 1. Images that convey information

- Does the image convey any information?

  &rarr; **The text alternative should convey the same information as the image.**

- It's not about describing what's on the image:
  - It's about serving the same purpose as the image: conveying the same information.
    - A picture can seek to convey different information in different contexts.

### Example

On a page promoting a holiday resort, the purpose of this picture might be to convey that the resort is family friendly.

<img src="../assets/family-938c2790.jpg" alt="We’re family-friendly.">

```html
<img src="family.jpg" alt="We’re family-friendly." />
```

---

## 2. Images that convey functionality

- Does the image describe what a button or a link is going to do?

  &rarr; **The text alternative should describe the action that will be performed.**

- It's not about describing what's on the image:

  - It's about serving the same purpose as the image: indicating what action will be triggered, or where users will be taken to.

- If the button or link also has text label, see [Images that are purely decorative or redundant](#images-that-are-purely-decorative-or-redundant) below.

### Example

<form>
  <div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
    <input type="search" style="height: 2rem;" />
    <button type="submit">
      <img src="../assets/search_icon_3r5y.png" style="width: 2rem; height: 2rem;" alt="Search">
    </button>
  </div>
</form>

```html
<form>
  <input type="search" />
  <button type="submit">
    <img src="search_icon.png" alt="Search" />
  </button>
</form>
```

---

## 3. Images that are purely decorative or redundant

- The image doesn't convey any information?

  Or it conveys information that's already conveyed in text?

  &rarr; It should be silenced (using `alt=''`), or be a CSS `background-image`.

- So that screen readers ignore it.

### Example

If a button's name is already included in text, the icon shouldn't be read out by screen readers.

<form>
  <div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
    <input type="search" style="height: 2rem;" />
    <button type="submit" style="display: flex; align-items: center; font-size: 1.2rem;">
      <img src="../assets/search_icon_3r5y.png" style="width: 2rem; height: 2rem;" alt="">
      Search
    </button>
  </div>
</form>

```html
<form>
  <input type="search" />
  <button type="submit">
    <img src="search_icon.png" alt="" />
    Search
  </button>
</form>
```

---

## 4. Complex images

- Does the communicate complex information (like an infographics, a chart or a diagram)?

  &rarr; The same information should be available in text or as a table within the same page.

## Common mistakes

<details>
  <summary>
    <h3 style="display: inline">Top 1 mistake: An `img` element without an `alt` attribute</h3>
  </summary>

- If an image doesn't have an `alt` attribute (or `role=` `'presentation'` or `'none'`), then screen readers will read the filename.
- Always give `img` elements an `alt` attribute

  - `role=` `'presentation'` or `'none'` achieve the same outcome. But using ARIA attributes is discouraged when the same outcome can be achieved using just HTML. See the [first rule of ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/#firstrule)

  <h4>Example</h4>

```html
<form>
  <input type="search" />
  <button type="submit">
    <img src="search_icon_jeo87668_medium_2x.png" alt="" />
    Search
  </button>
  /* Screen readers would say "search underscore icon underscore jeo87668
  underscore medium underscore 2x.png Search, button" */
</form>
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <h3 style="display: inline">Top 2 mistake: A text alternative that does not serve the same purpose as the image</h3>
  </summary>

  <h4>Example 1</h4>

```html
<form>
  <input type="search" />
  <button type="submit">
    <img src="search_icon.png" alt="Magnifying glass" />
    /* The purpose of this magnifying glass icon is to convey a 'Search'
    functionality. So its alternative text should be 'Search', not 'Magnifying
    glass'. */
  </button>
</form>
```

<h4>Example 2</h4>

```html
<img src="family.jpg" alt="A man, a woman and their son smiling." /> /* This alt
text describes what's on the image, but doesn't serve the same purpose as the
image. */
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <h3 style="display: inline">Top 3 mistake: A text alternative that includes redundant words like 'image', 'icon', 'button' or 'select this to ...'</h3>
  </summary>

- The type of the element (such as image or button) should not be included in the text alternative.

  - Because it is programmatically determined (based on the HTML element's tag name or `role` attribute) and announced by the screen reader.

<h4>Example 1</h4>

```html
<button>
  <img src="play.png" alt="Play button" />
  /* The alt text should not include 'button'. This would be read out by screen
  readers as "Play button, button" */
</button>
```

<h4>Example 2</h4>

```html
<img src="family.jpg" alt="Picture of a happy family." /> /* This would be read
out by screen readers as "Picture of a happy family, image" */
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <h3 style="display: inline">Top 4 mistake: Using CSS <code>background-image</code> images that are not purely decorative or redundant</h3>
  </summary>

- Do not use a CSS `background-image` for images that convey purpose or information not already available in text.
  - Because background images are not available to assistive technologies.
- CSS background images may only used for:
  - decorative images
  - images that communicate information or functionality that's also described in text.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <h3 style="display: inline">Top 5 mistake: A text alternative that is too verbose</h3>
  </summary>

- Try to be succinct (50 characters max). Verbose alternatives make content harder to listen to and understand for screen reader users.

  <summary>Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</summary>

> [**1.1.1 Non-text Content:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html) All [non-text content](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html#non-text-contentdef) that is presented to the user has a [text alternative](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html#text-altdef) that serves the equivalent purpose, except for the situations listed below. (Level A)
>
> - **Controls, Input**: If non-text content is a control or accepts user input, then it has a [name](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html#namedef) that describes its purpose.
>
> - **Time-Based Media**: If non-text content is time-based media, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.
>
> - **Test**: If non-text content is a test or exercise that would be invalid if presented in [text](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html#textdef), then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.
>
> - **Sensory**: If non-text content is primarily intended to create a [specific sensory experience](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html#sensoryexpdef), then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.
>
> - **CAPTCHA**: If the purpose of non-text content is to confirm that content is being accessed by a person rather than a computer, then text alternatives that identify and describe the purpose of the non-text content are provided, and alternative forms of [CAPTCHA](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html#CAPTCHAdef) using output modes for different types of sensory perception are provided to accommodate different disabilities.
>
> - **Decoration, Formatting, Invisible**: If non-text content is [pure decoration](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html#puredecdef), is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users, then it is implemented in a way that it can be ignored by [assistive technology](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html#atdef).
