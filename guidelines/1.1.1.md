# Text alternative for images

> Provide a text description for images. Make sure the description serves the same purpose as the image.

## What?

All non-text content like images, charts, icons and infographics, must have an appropriate text equivalent.

### Requirements

* Images (like logos and icons) that communicate information have short text descriptions.
* Editorial images that support the text around them have short descriptions.
* Images (like infographics, charts and diagrams) that communicate complex information also have longer text descriptions within the same page.
* Images that are purely decorative (i.e. that do not convey any information) have empty text descriptions and are not read out by screen readers.

### Official guidelines

* [1.1.1 "Non-text content" (A) in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html)

## Why?

This ensures that information conveyed by non-text content is available to people who cannot see it, like screen reader users.

## How?

### Design

Define what the text equivalent should be.

### iOS

Giving a **non-decorative** `UIImageView` a label:

```swift
logoImageView.isAccessibilityElement = true
logoImageView.accessibilityLabel = "Company Name"
```

Hiding a **decorative** `UIImageView` from screen readers:

```swift
decorativeImageView.isAccessibilityElement = false
```

### Android

Giving a **non-decorative** `ImageView` a label:

```kotlin
imageView.importantForAccessibility = IMPORTANT_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY_YES //optional, because all views that are focusable are important for accessibility
imageView.contentDescription = "Company Name"
```

```xml
android:contentDescription="Company Name"
```

Hiding a **decorative** `ImageView` from screen readers:

```kotlin
imageView.importantForAccessibility = IMPORTANT_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY_NO
```
