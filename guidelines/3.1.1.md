## Summary

**In code, identify the language that the content of the page is written in (English for example).**

---

## Requirements

* The written language of every page must be identified in the code of the web page/app.

### Why?

This makes sure that screen readers automatically use the correct speech libraries for accent and pronunciation.

#### Other benefits for the Web

In HTML, correctly setting the `lang` attribute also has other benefits:
* The quotation marks that appear around the content of `<q>` elements are different for different languages;
* The [`spellcheck` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/spellcheck) needs it to function properly, especially for multilingual users, as browser heuristics arenâ€™t perfect;
* Input components for dates and times also need it, because times and dates are written differently around the world.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**3.1.1 Language of Page:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/meaning-doc-lang-id.html) The default [human language](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/meaning-doc-lang-id.html#human-langdef) of each [Web page](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/meaning-doc-lang-id.html#webpagedef) can be [programmatically determined](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/meaning-doc-lang-id.html#programmaticallydetermineddef). (Level A)

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/meaning-doc-lang-id.html) with techniques and examples.

## Guidance for Web

*   The language of the page is identified using the `lang` attribute of the `html` element.

```html
<html lang="en">
...
</html>
```

Note: It's better to only use the two-letter code representing the language (like `lang="en"`), rather than including the country as well (like `lang="en-gb"` or `lang="en-us"`):
*   If you use `lang="en-gb"`, the content will be pronounced by screen readers with a British accent, regardless of the users' preferences. That's not ideal.
*   If you use just `lang="en"`, the content will be pronounced with the accent that matches the users' preferences.

### Common mistakes

*   No `lang` attribute is present on the `html` element.
*   The `lang` attribute is present on the `html` element, but it incorrectly identifies the language of the page.
