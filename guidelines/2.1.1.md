## Summary

**Make sure every task can be completed using just a keyboard.**

It must be possible for someone using a keyboard to complete all tasks in a website or app. This ensures that people with mobility impairments who do not use a mouse can successfully complete their goals.

---

## Requirements

* All actionable components can be reached and activated using the keyboard alone.

### Why?

* This ensures that people with mobility impairments who do not use a mouse can successfully complete their goals.

* Lots of people don't rely on a mouse, trackpad or touchscreen to use websites and apps:
  * People who have developed Repetitive Strain Injuries or Arthritis;
  * Screen reader users;
  * Computer power users find keyboard keys and shortcuts to navigate the web.

* Making a website or app accessible with a keyboard also ensures that it is accessible with other input devices that emulate keyboards, like Switch devices or Sip-and-puff devices.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**2.1.1 Keyboard:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/keyboard-operation-keyboard-operable.html) All [functionality](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/keyboard-operation-keyboard-operable.html#functiondef) of the content is operable through a [keyboard interface](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/keyboard-operation-keyboard-operable.html#keybrd-interfacedef) without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints. (Level A)
> 
> Note 1: This exception relates to the underlying function, not the input technique. For example, if using handwriting to enter text, the input technique (handwriting) requires path-dependent input but the underlying function (text input) does not.
> 
> Note 2: This does not forbid and should not discourage providing mouse input or other input methods in addition to keyboard operation.

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/keyboard-operation-keyboard-operable.html) with techniques and examples.

## Guidance for Web

### Common mistakes

* A custom widget has been created, but the necessary keyboard support has not been provided. For example:
  * buttons created using `span` or `div` elements rather than `button` or `input` elements
  * links created using the `span` or `div`, rather than the `a` element
  * links using a `a` element but without a URL for their `href` attribute, or if `preventDefault()` has been used
* An `<a>` element has been used as the basis for a button, but the additional keyboard interaction (activation with the space key) has not been provided;
* The `tabindex` attribute has been used on an element with a value of `-1` to mistakenly remove it from the [tab order](./definitions.md#tab-order).
