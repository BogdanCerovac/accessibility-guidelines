# Use of colour

> Do not use colour as the only way to convey any piece of information.

## What?

Colour alone is not used to convey information (e.g. to identify form fields with invalid entries or the current step in a step indicator) or to distinguish between areas of a map or graph.

### Requirements

* When rendered in monochrome, information does not disappear.
* Text identified by colour as having special meaning has another indicator - a visible border and label, underline or other visual effect.
* Information graphics and charts that use colour as a key also provide distinctive non-colour differences - hatching patterns or directly applied labels.

### Official guidelines

* [1.4.1 Use of Colour (A) in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-without-color.html)

## Why?

This ensures that people who are unable to see colours, or who have difficulty telling different colours apart, have some other way to do so.

## How?

### Design

#### Common mistakes

* A form uses only colour to indicate a required field.
* Colour-coding text or backgrounds to indicate essential content, pass/fail categorisation, etc.
* Links are only distinguished from plain text by colour and the colour may not vary from the main body text.
* Text alternatives that do not include information conveyed by colour differences in the original image.
* The error state of a input field is only identified by changing the colour of its border.

#### How to style links

* It's best for all links within blocks of text are underlined, and no other content on the page to be underlined.
* If links cannot be underlined and are identified via colour alone, the contrast ratio between their colour and the colour of the surrounding text is at least 3:1, and their visual appearance changes (e.g. they become underlined) when they receive the mouse hover and keyboard focus.
  * Note that this method doesn't help users using touch screen devices
* Links in a navigation menu do not need underlining, as their presence of a navigation menu makes it obvious that they're links
