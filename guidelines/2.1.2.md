## Summary

**Make sure that keyboard-only users don't get trapped within any element.**

When someone using a keyboard to navigate content moves to an element, they must be able to move away from it again.

---

## Requirements

* Keyboard focus can move to an element and away again.

### Common mistakes

* A dialogue opens but cannot be closed with the keyboard, preventing the user from accessing the original content underneath;
* Content is presented in an infinite scroll, so a keyboard user is forced to tab through everything before they can exit the scroll area.

### Why?

This ensures that people who use a keyboard do not get stuck on any part of the page.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/keyboard-operation-trapping.html) If keyboard focus can be moved to a component of the page using a [keyboard interface](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/keyboard-operation-trapping.html#keybrd-interfacedef), then focus can be moved away from that component using only a keyboard interface, and, if it requires more than unmodified arrow or tab keys or other standard exit methods, the user is advised of the method for moving focus away. (Level A)
