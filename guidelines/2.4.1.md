## Summary

**Give keyboard and screen reader users a way to go directly to the page's main content.** [Web only]

When there is repeated content (like a header with navigation links) at the top of the page, there must be a way for keyboard users to move focus directly to the start of the main content area of the page.

---

## Requirements (Web-only)

*   A "Skip to content" link is provided, to allow users to to the main content area;
*   The "Skip to content" the link is located close to the start of the page;
*   If the "Skip to content" link is hidden at initially, it becomes visible when it receives [keyboard focus](./definitions.md#keyboard-focus)
*   The `<main>` element is used to represent the main content area of the page.

### Common mistakes

*   The `<main>` element has been used, but there is no skip link that points to it;
*   A skip link is provided, but it is always visually hidden and only available to screen reader users.

### Why?

This ensures that people who do not use a mouse can quickly and easily reach the primary content of the page.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**2.4.1 Bypass Blocks:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-skip.html) A [mechanism](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-skip.html#mechanismdef) is available to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on multiple [Web pages](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-skip.html#webpagedef). (Level A)

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-skip.html) with techniques and examples.

---

## Guidance for Design

* Provide visual styles and position for when the link received [keyboard focus](./definitions.md#keyboard-focus)
* Label the link 'Skip to content' (like the BBC) or 'Skip to main content' (like Google)

### Examples

* [BBC homepage](https://www.bbc.co.uk/)
* [Deque.com](https://www.deque.com/)

---

## Guidance for Web

* The "Skip to main content" link points to the page's `main` element, using the `main` element's `id`

#### More guidance for Web

* See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-skip.html) with techniques and examples.
