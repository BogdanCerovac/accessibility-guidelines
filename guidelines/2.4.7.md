## Summary

**Make sure that keyboard-only users can clearly see which interactive control is focused when they tab through them.**

It should be easy to tell which element has [keyboard focus](./definitions.md#keyboard-focus).

---

## Requirements

* When actionable items receive the [keyboard focus](./definitions.md#keyboard-focus), their visual appearance changes (e.g. a box appears around them, links become underlined, the colour of the text or of the background changes).

### Related requirements

* See the ['Non-text contrast'](./1.4.11.md) for requirements about the contrast of the [keyboard focus](./definitions.md#keyboard-focus) indicators.

### Common mistakes

* The keyboard focus indicator has been suppressed.

### Why?

* Sighted keyboard and switch device users track where they are on a page/screen as they navigate through focusable elements, similar to using a remote control with a TV interface.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**2.4.7 Focus Visible:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-focus-visible.html) Any keyboard operable user interface has a mode of operation where the keyboard focus indicator is visible. (Level AA)

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-focus-visible.html) with techniques and examples.

## Guidance for Design

* Do not remove the browser's default focus indicator unless you're also providing an alternative [keyboard focus](./definitions.md#keyboard-focus) indicator.

### Doing better

#### Include keyboard focus state for all interactive components in your designs

* Do not depend on a browser's default visible states for [keyboard focus](./definitions.md#keyboard-focus).
  * Their colour may clash with your design or blend into the background colour.
  * Some browser's default focus indicators have very poor contrast.

## Guidance for Web

### Do not disable focus styles, unless you've already implemented improved focus styles

By default, native HTML elements have a visual focus indicator provided by the browser. Therefore, links and focusable elements must not have their outline suppressed via CSS, unless a custom focus indicator is provided.

#### Failure example

```html
// Never do this,
// unless you’ve already replaced the default focus outline with better custom focus styles!

<style>
a {
 outline: none; /* or outline: 0;*/
 } 
</style>

<!--  -->

<a href="..."> Next </a>  
```

### To prevent keyboard focus styles from appearing when custom (non-native) elements get clicked or touched, use the [`:focus-visible` polyfill](https://wicg.github.io/focus-visible/explainer.html)

#### What's the use case?

When users touch or click on a button, they don’t expect to see a focus ring appear around it.
And indeed, browsers don’t show focus rings around native HTML buttons when they’re clicked.

But custom buttons created from `div` or `span` elements receive a focus ring even when clicked on touched. (That’s also true of other elements, like `option`).

Sometimes clients or designers don’t like to see a focus ring appear on a custom button or element when it gets clicked. They might say to a developer: “Get rid of that focus ring”.

But if you got rid of focus rings entirely, the interface would become unusable for keyboard users.

#### How the `:focus-visible` CSS selector solves that problem

Using the `:focus-visible` CSS selector allows you to …

* disable focus ring styles on elements when they are focused via mouse / touch
* … while leaving them intact when that element gets focused using the keyboard or in code.

Note: If you use native HTML elements (like `button`, `input type="button"`) you won't have that problem. They don't receive keyboard focus styles when clicked or touched.

In itself, :focus-visible doesn’t have any accessibility benefit. Just keeping the focus visible for all users is fine from an accessibility perspective. But it’s a good way to handle clients or designers’ requests for the focus ring to be removed for mouse or touch users, which would disable keyboard users.

#### You need a polyfill to use `:focus-visible`

As of Nov 2019 `:focus-visible` is only supported by Chrome, but the [`:focus-visible` polyfill](https://wicg.github.io/focus-visible/explainer.html) is small and robust. You do not need to use it if you use native HTML elements for buttons (`button` or `input type="button"` rather than `div` or `span`).
