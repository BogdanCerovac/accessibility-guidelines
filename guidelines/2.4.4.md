## Summary

**Make sure the purpose of every link is clear from the link text alone, or together with associated content (if screen readers recognise the association).**

The purpose of every link must be clear from its link text, or its link text plus associated content if assistive technologies recognise the association.

---

## Requirements

* Link text clearly indicates the purpose of the link ...
  * Ideally by the link text on its own
    * For example, the link [Deque's Web Accessibility Quick Checklist for Designers](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/153358/Web%20Accessibility%20Quick%20Checklist%20for%20Designers.pdf?utm_referrer=https://www.deque.com/blog/supporting-the-design-phase-with-accessibility-heuristics-evaluations/) indicates its purpose by its text alone because it is the unique name of the content it points to
  * Or by the link text together with associated content, if the association is one that screen readers understand. For example:
      * A link named 'Order' in a table or a list item, where the associated row header is the name of a product
      * A link named 'See invoice' that is programatically associated with the name of an item, using `aria-describedby` for example
      * A link named 'Email' just under a header with the name of a person
* Multiple links that point to the same destination have the same link text;
* Links have accessible names.

### Common mistakes

* A link has text that does not indicate its purpose (for example 'Click here');
* A link points to the same destination as another link, but uses different link text;
* A link points to a unique destination, but uses the same text as other links;
* A link has text that depends on nearby content to be understood, but that association is not automatically identified by assistive technologies;
* The doesn't have a name that's available to assistive technologies (like a link that's an image without text nor an alt attribute).

### Why?

This ensures that screen reader users can understand the purpose of links without reading nearby content, and that speech recognition users can target links accurately using voice commands.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context):**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-refs.html) The [purpose of each link](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-refs.html#linkpurposedef) can be determined from the link text alone or from the link text together with its [programmatically determined link context](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-refs.html#pdlinkcontextdef), except where the purpose of the link would be [ambiguous to users in general](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-refs.html#ambiguouslinkdef). (Level A)

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-refs.html) with techniques and examples.

## Guidance for Design

* When using an icon to indicate a link, indicate the accessible name for that image (aka 'alt text') on your designs
* The alternative name for an icon that indicates a link should describe the purpose or destination of the link, rather than what the icon looks like
* If you design has links that don't indicate their purpose with their text alone, ensure that either:
  * Your designs also indicate a slightly longer name for that link, inclusing text that should be hidden visually but available to screen reader users
  * The purpose of the link is clear from its context, and that relation is one that screen readers recognise (such as a a list or a table in HTML)

## Guidance for iOS

### Adding a hint to a link

```swift
label.isAccessibilityElement = true
label.accessibilityTraits = [.link]
label.accessibilityHint = "Select to be taken to example.com"
```

> NOTE: Links detected in UITextViews cannot be given a hint so copy will have to be crafted in a way that their purposes are clear in the context in which they are discovered.

### More guidance for iOS

* [UITextView developer reference](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitextview "developer.apple.com reference")

## Guidance for Web

* See also [Guidance for Design](#guidance-for-design) section
* You can use a `.visually-hidden` CSS class to extend a link's name without lengthening its visible name
```css
.visually-hidden {
  clip-path: inset(100%);
  clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);
  height: 1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  position: absolute;
  white-space: nowrap;
  width: 1px;
}
```

### Common mistakes

* The link doesn't have a name that's available to assistive technologies, for example:
  * A link that's an image without text nor an alt attribute
  * A link that's a CSS background image, and has no visible accessible name
