## Summary

**Make sure a page's view is not locked to either portrait or landscape mode, unless this is essential.**

A page view must not be locked to either horizontal (landscape) or vertical (portrait) views only, unless this is essential.

Here are some examples of when locking the orientation to one direction may considered ‘essential’:
* in a messaging app
* when making music using a piano app
* when viewing slides for a projector show
* for television or virtual reality content.

---

## Requirements

* Each page/screen should be viewable both in horizontal (landscape) and vertical (portrait) orientation.

### Common mistakes

* Locking the orientation of the device so it is set in one way only, and does not adapt.

### Why?

* Users with low-vision should be able to view content in the orientation that works best for them, due to the need for increased text size;
* Some users with mobility impairments mount their device to a wheelchair, and need to see content in their preferred orientation.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**Success Criterion 1.3.4 Orientation:**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/orientation.html) Content does not restrict its view and operation to a single display orientation, such as portrait or landscape, unless a specific display orientation is [essential](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/orientation.html#dfn-essential). (Level AA)
> 
> Examples where a particular display orientation may be essential are a bank check, a piano application, slides for a projector or television, or virtual reality content where content is not necessarily restricted to landscape or portrait display orientation.

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/orientation.html) with techniques and examples.

## Guidance for Design

* Do not design in such a way that assumes a particular orientation.
* Use show/hide buttons to allow access to content in different orientations.

## Guidance for iOS

There are several ways to control orientation in iOS apps. The simplest is to override `supportedInterfaceOrientations` in view controllers:

```swift
override var supportedInterfaceOrientations: UIInterfaceOrientationMask {
	switch UIDevice.current.userInterfaceIdiom {
		case .phone: return .allButUpsideDown
		default: return .all
	}
}
```
> **NOTE:** iPad by default allows `.all` orientations, iPhone allows `.allButUpsideDown` since the iPhone X does not support upside down due to the notch.

You can also use the `UIApplicationDelegate` `supportedInterfaceOrientationsFor` callback:

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, supportedInterfaceOrientationsFor window: UIWindow?) -> UIInterfaceOrientationMask {
	switch UIDevice.current.userInterfaceIdiom {
		case .phone: return .allButUpsideDown
		default: return .all
	}
}
```

Finally, you can also use the value set in the app's Info.plist by setting the `UISupportedInterfaceOrientations` array:

```xml
<key>UISupportedInterfaceOrientations</key>
<array>
  <string>UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait</string>
  <string>UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft</string>
  <string>UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight</string>
</array>
<key>UISupportedInterfaceOrientations~ipad</key>
<array>
  <string>UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait</string>
  <string>UIInterfaceOrientationPortraitUpsideDown</string>
  <string>UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft</string>
  <string>UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight</string>
</array>
```

## Guidance for Android

By default Android supports both portait and landscape mode.

There is a way to lock it in either mode : (Do that only if it's necessary)
```xml
<activity android:name=".yourActivity" android:screenOrientation="portrait" ... />
```

The orientation can be handled by the developer as well.
```xml
<activity android:name=".yourActivity"
          android:configChanges="orientation|keyboardHidden"
          android:label="@string/app_name">
```
So the orientation can be handled in code:
```kotlin
override fun onConfigurationChanged(newConfig: Configuration) {
    super.onConfigurationChanged(newConfig)

    // Checks the orientation of the screen
    if (newConfig.orientation === Configuration.ORIENTATION_LANDSCAPE) {
        Toast.makeText(this, "landscape", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
    } else if (newConfig.orientation === Configuration.ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT) {
        Toast.makeText(this, "portrait", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
    }
}
```
But that comes with risks because most of the resources won't be handled. (Layouts in different orientations, etc...)
