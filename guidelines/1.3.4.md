# Orientation

> Make sure a page's view is not locked to either landscape or portrait only, unless this is essential.

## What?

A page view must not be locked to either horizontal (landscape) or vertical (portrait) views only, unless this is essential. ‘Essential’ orientation may considered to be in a messaging app, or when making music using a piano type application, viewing slides for a projector show, television or virtual reality content.

### Requirements

* Each page/screen should be viewed in an orientation that suits the user.

### Official guidelines

* [1.3.4 "Orientation" (A) in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/orientation.html)

## Why?

Users with low-vision should be able to view content in the orientation that works best for them, due to the need for increased text size. For users with dexterity impairments, who mount a mobile device or tablet (i.e. mounted to a wheelchair), they will need to see content in their preferred way.

## How?

### Design

Ensure designs cater for multiple screen widths and heights, and do not design in such a way that assumes a particular orientation (with the exception of "essential" interfaces, as described above).

### iOS

There are several ways to control orientation in iOS apps. The simplest is to override `supportedInterfaceOrientations` in view controllers:

```swift
override var supportedInterfaceOrientations: UIInterfaceOrientationMask {
	switch UIDevice.current.userInterfaceIdiom {
		case .phone: return .allButUpsideDown
		default: return .all
	}
}
```
> **NOTE:** iPad by default allows `.all` orientations, iPhone allows `.allButUpsideDown` since the iPhone X does not support upside down due to the notch.

You can also use the `UIApplicationDelegate` `supportedInterfaceOrientationsFor` callback:

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, supportedInterfaceOrientationsFor window: UIWindow?) -> UIInterfaceOrientationMask {
	switch UIDevice.current.userInterfaceIdiom {
		case .phone: return .allButUpsideDown
		default: return .all
	}
}
```

Finally, you can also use the value set in the app's Info.plist by setting the `UISupportedInterfaceOrientations` array:

```xml
<key>UISupportedInterfaceOrientations</key>
<array>
  <string>UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait</string>
  <string>UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft</string>
  <string>UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight</string>
</array>
<key>UISupportedInterfaceOrientations~ipad</key>
<array>
  <string>UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait</string>
  <string>UIInterfaceOrientationPortraitUpsideDown</string>
  <string>UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft</string>
  <string>UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight</string>
</array>
```

### Android

By default Android supports both portait and landscape mode.

There is a way to lock it in either mode : (Do that only if it's necessary)
```xml
<activity android:name=".yourActivity" android:screenOrientation="portrait" ... />
```

The orientation can be handled by the developer as well.
```xml
<activity android:name=".yourActivity"
          android:configChanges="orientation|keyboardHidden"
          android:label="@string/app_name">
```
So the orientation can be handled in code:
```kotlin
override fun onConfigurationChanged(newConfig: Configuration) {
    super.onConfigurationChanged(newConfig)

    // Checks the orientation of the screen
    if (newConfig.orientation === Configuration.ORIENTATION_LANDSCAPE) {
        Toast.makeText(this, "landscape", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
    } else if (newConfig.orientation === Configuration.ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT) {
        Toast.makeText(this, "portrait", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
    }
}
```
But that comes with risks because most of the resources won't be handled. (Layouts in different orientations, etc...)
