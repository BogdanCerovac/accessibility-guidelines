## Summary

**Make sure users can access all information and functionality on a screen that's as wide as on the iPhone5, without needing to scroll in both directions.**

On smaller devices or when content is zoomed there should be no loss of information or functionality, and users should not be required to scroll content both vertically and horizontally.

---

## Requirements

### Requirements for both native and web

* Make sure that all content and functionality are available on 320pt-wide screens.

### Web only requirements

* Make sure your pages are responsive and the content will ‘reflow’ to a single column gracefully.
* A simple browser based test is to view the page with a viewport width of 320px, or 1280px at 400% zoom.
  * You can zoom in on a Mac in Chrome by pressing Command and + key, until you see the resolution hit 400%.

#### Common mistakes

* Content does not reflow to a single column when zoomed.
* Horizontal scrolling appears in both directions at some low resolutions when content is zoomed.
* Using fixed sized containers and fixed position content.

### Why?

* People who are sight impaired often use screen magnification to resize page content and this can cause info to get lost.
* Scrolling can often be difficult for some disabled users, more so when horizontally or both horizontally and vertically at the same time.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**1.4.10 Reflow (Level AA):**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/reflow.html) Content can be presented without loss of information or functionality, and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions for:
> 
> * Vertical scrolling content at a width equivalent to 320 [CSS pixels](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/reflow.html#dfn-css-pixel);
> * Horizontal scrolling content at a height equivalent to 256 [CSS pixels](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/reflow.html#dfn-css-pixel).
> 
> Except for parts of the content which require two-dimensional layout for usage or meaning.
> 
> Note: 320 CSS pixels is equivalent to a starting viewport width of 1280 CSS pixels wide at 400% zoom. For web content which is designed to scroll horizontally (e.g., with vertical text), 256 CSS pixels is equivalent to a starting viewport height of 1024 CSS pixels at 400% zoom.
> 
> Examples of content which requires two-dimensional layout are images, maps, diagrams, video, games, presentations, data tables, and interfaces where it is necessary to keep toolbars in view while manipulating content.

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/reflow.html) with techniques and examples.

## Guidance for iOS

```swift
// Allowing a label to wrap onto multiple lines
label.numberOfLines = 0

// Reacting to changes in the trait collection, like contentSizeCategory and sizeClass
override func traitCollectionDidChange(_ previousTraitCollection: UITraitCollection?) {
    super.traitCollectionDidChange(previousTraitCollection)
    if traitCollection.horizontalSizeClass == .compact {
      stackView.axis = .vertical
    } else {
      stackView.axis = .horiztonal
    }

    if traitCollection.preferredContentSizeCategory >= .accessibilityLarge {
        stackView.axis = .vertical
    } else {
        stackView.axis = .horiztonal
    }
}
```

> NOTE: You could also observe traitCollectionDidChange to modify UICollectionView layouts to reflow your layout.

### Displaying code

The use of &lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt; formatted content (such as code) can cause horizontal scrolling. Using the CSS declarations such as word-wrap: break-word; on &lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt; in small viewports will help to avoid horizontal scrolling at all.
