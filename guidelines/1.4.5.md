## Summary

**Use real text rather than images of text.**

Text must not be presented as part of an image because it cannot be resized, and it deteriorates in quality when magnified.

---

## Requirements

*   Text is not presented as part of an image;
*   Text is presented using plain text and styled with CSS.

##### Common mistakes

*   Images contain text.

### Why?

This is so that everyone is able to read and access information presented in text.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**1.4.5 Images of Text:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-text-presentation.html) If the technologies being used can achieve the visual presentation, [text](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-text-presentation.html#textdef) is used to convey information rather than [images of text](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-text-presentation.html#images-of-textdef) except for the following: (Level AA)
>
> * **Customizable**: The image of text can be [visually customized](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-text-presentation.html#visually-customizeddef) to the user's requirements;
> * **Essential**: A particular presentation of text is [essential](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-text-presentation.html#essentialdef) to the information being conveyed. Logotypes (text that is part of a logo or brand name) are considered essential.

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-text-presentation.html) with techniques and examples.
