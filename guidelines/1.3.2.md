# Order of elements in code

> Make sure that elements appear in a logical reading order in code, so that they are presented in a meaningful order to screen reader users.

## What?

When the order of content is important, the content order must be preserved no matter how it is presented to the user.

### Requirements

* The visual order of content matches the underlying code order;
* Tabular data is presented using proper HTML markup (`<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` elements).

### Official guidelines

* [1.3.2 "Meaningful sequence" (A) in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-sequence.html)

## Why?

This ensures that the order of content is meaningful whether someone is looking at it, listening to it with a screen reader, or has stripped out visual styling using a browser plugin.

## How?

### iOS

Setting a custom order for child elements:

```swift
containerView.isAccessibilityElement = false
containerView.accessibilityElements = [firstLabel, secondLabel, button]
```

### Web

#### Common mistakes

*   The DOM order does not match the visual order because CSS properties like flexbox and grid-layout have been used to alter the visual presentation;
*   When CSS styles are disabled, the content order is meaningless;
*   Tabular data is displayed using CSS to present the appearance of a table, but the proper HTML markup has not been used;
*   The tabindex attribute has been used to force a tab order through the content.
