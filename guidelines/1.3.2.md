# Order of elements in code

> Make sure that elements appear in a logical reading order in code, so that they are presented in a meaningful order to screen reader users.

## What?

Content on the page needs to be announced by screen readers in a logical reading order.
Interactive elements need to appear in the [tab order](./definitions.md#tab-order) in a logical reading order.

In most cases, a 'logical reading order' is top-to-bottom and left-to-right. 

### Requirements

#### Requirements for both native and web

* The visual order of content (following a logical reading order) matches the underlying order of elements in code, because it's the order of element in code that determines the order in which screen readers announce content and interactive elements receive keyboard focus.

#### Web-only requirements

* Tabular data is presented using proper HTML markup (`<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` elements)

### Official guidelines

* [1.3.2 "Meaningful sequence" (A) in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-sequence.html)

## Why?

This ensures that the order of content is meaningful whether someone is looking at it, listening to it with a screen reader, or has stripped out visual styling using a browser plugin.

## How?

### iOS

Setting a custom order for child elements:

```swift
containerView.isAccessibilityElement = false
containerView.accessibilityElements = [firstLabel, secondLabel, button]
```

### Android
By default all focussable views will be read from the screen reader from the top down.  
But there is a wat to set a custom order for child elements.  
It is essentially providing next focussed target for keyboard input.  
The container doesn't need any special flags for it to work.  

```xml
<RelativeLayout ...>
    <Button
        android:id="@+id/button1"
        android:nextFocusForward="@+id/editText1"
        ... />
    <Button
        android:id="@+id/button2"
        android:nextFocusForward="@+id/button1"
        ... />
    <EditText
        android:id="@id/editText1"
        android:nextFocusForward="@+id/button2"
        ...  />
    ...
</RelativeLayout>
```

Alternative from API 22 is to specify the traversal order `android:accessibilityTraversalAfter="@id"`.  
This is the recommended way but there is the API 22 restriction.
```xml
<RelativeLayout ...>
    <Button
        android:id="@+id/button1"
        android:accessibilityTraversalAfter="@+id/editText1"
        ... />
    <Button
        android:id="@+id/button2"
        android:accessibilityTraversalAfter="@+id/button1"
        ... />
    <EditText
        android:id="@id/editText1"
        android:accessibilityTraversalAfter="@+id/button2"
        ...  />
    ...
</RelativeLayout>
```

### Web

#### Common mistakes

*   The DOM order does not match the visual order because CSS properties like flexbox and grid-layout have been used to alter the visual presentation;
*   When CSS styles are disabled, the content order is meaningless;
*   Tabular data is displayed using CSS to present the appearance of a table, but the proper HTML markup has not been used;
*   The tabindex attribute has been used to force a tab order through the content.
