# Transcript (audio-only content)

> For audio content that has no video (like a podcast), provide a transcript

## What?

All content that is audio-only like a podcast, or video-only like a silent movie, must have a text description or an audio description.

### Requirements

* Audio only content that communicates information (like a podcast) has a text transcript;
* Video-only content that communicates information (like a silent movie) has a text transcript that describes the video or a audio description.

### Official guidelines
