## Summary

**If a text input field collects information about the user, identify its specific purpose in code (for example email, password or given name).**

When an input field collects information **about to the user** (for example, if the input field is collecting the user's name, as opposed to the name of one of their friends), then its purpose needs to be identified in code in ways that can be understood by Assistive Technologies and browsers.

For example, if an HTML `input` field collects the user's first name, adding the `autocomplete="given-name"` attribute lets the browser and screen readers know what the purpose of the input field is.

Note that if the input field was not collecting information about the user themselves (but about one of their friends, for example), it should not have this attribute.

## Requirements

### Requirements for both native and web

This section needs more content. [Contribute via Github](https://github.com/theappbusiness/accessibility-guidelines/) or [email](mailto:jeanfrancois@theappbusiness.com).

### Web only requirements

- Using the [HTML 5.2 `autocomplete` attribute](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/sec-forms.html#sec-autofill) on `input` fields that collect information about the user.

**Note:** Remember that you should only add the `autocomplete` attribute to `input`s that collect **information about the user**.

### Why?

- People with language and memory problems or disabilities benefit from the system auto-filling their information.
- People with motor impairments also benefit from not having to fill in forms with the same information when the system can do it for them.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose:**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/identify-input-purpose.html) The purpose of each input field collecting information about the user can be [programmatically determined](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/identify-input-purpose.html#dfn-programmatically-determined) when: (Level AA)
>
> - The input field serves a purpose identified in the [Input Purposes for User Interface Components](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#input-purposes) section; and
> - The content is implemented using technologies with support for identifying the expected meaning for form input data.

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/identify-input-purpose.html) with techniques and examples.

## Guidance for iOS

Setting specific content types on labels, which will automatically present options that iOS knows about to the user:

```swift
prefixLabel.textContentType = .namePrefix
firstNameLabel.textContentType = .givenName
surnameLabel.textContentType = .familyName
suffixLabel.textContentType = .nameSuffix
phoneNumberLabel.textContentType = .telephoneNumber
creditCardNumber.textContentType = .creditCardNumber
```

### More guidance for iOS

---

## Guidance for Android

For `ImageView`, `ImageButton`, `Check Box` or other Views use :

```xml
android:contentDescription="label"
```

For `EditTexts` and `TextViews` use :

```xml
android:hint="label"
```

If a View needs to be a label for another View use :

```xml
android:labelFor="@id/edit_text"
```

## Guidance for Flutter

Flutter deals with assistive technologies like screen readers using the `Semantics()` widget.

### For widgets `Icon()` and `Text()` you can use:

```dart
semanticLabel:'label'
```

### For `Image.asset()` you can use both:

```dart
semanticLabel:'label'

//and

excludeFromSemantics:bool
```

### For `TextFields()` the `InputDecoration()` will handle the semantics:

```dart
TextField(
    decoration: InputDecoration(
        hintText: 'Testing hint', // this has its own semantics
        labelText: labelText.toUpperCase(), // this has its own semantics
    ),
)
// You can achieve more control using the different semantics widgets shown below
```

### For widgets that need semantics but do not have them or for greater control of widget semantics you can use:

```dart
// Note that all the properties of these widgets are optional

// This widget will add semantics properties to its child though some of them might be overwritten if the child widget has its own semantic properties
Semantics( //The `Semantics()` widget has many properties not all are listed here
    lable:'label',
    excludeSemantics: bool, // false by default
    child: MyWidget()
)

// This will exclude the semantics of its child based on the bool value of `excluding:` which is true by default
ExcludeSemantics(
    excluding: bool, // true by default
    child: MyWidget(),
)

// This will merge all of the semantics of its child and its children all the way down the widget tree
MergeSemantics(child: MyWidget())

// This will block any semantics of a widget drawn below it e.g an alert should usually block interaction with any widget located "behind" the alert (even when they are still partially visible)
BlockSemantics(
    blocking:bool, // true by default
    child: MyWidget(),
)
```

## Guidance for Web

### Collecting data about a user using `input` fields the `autocomplete` attribute:

Here's an example of a form collecting data on a user with autocomplete attributes:

```html
<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<label for="1">Name</label>
<input type="text" name="1" id="1" autocomplete="name" />
<label for="2">Honorific / Prefix</label>
<input type="text" name="2" id="2" autocomplete="honorific-prefix" />
<label for="3">Given Name</label>
<input type="text" name="3" id="3" autocomplete="given-name" />
<label for="4">Additional Name</label>
<input type="text" name="4" id="4" autocomplete="additional-name" />
<label for="5">Family name</label>
<input type="text" name="5" id="5" autocomplete="family-name" />
<label for="6">Honorific Suffix</label>
<input type="text" name="6" id="6" autocomplete="honorific-suffix" />
```

**Note:** Remember that you should only add the `autocomplete` attribute to `input`s that collect **information about the user**.

### Common mistakes

- Building a form that collects information about the user without the autocomplete (or other semantic that identifies the purpose of the input).
- Putting the `autocomplete` attribute on input fields that collect information that is not about the user themselves (for example, if the input field is for collecting information about a friend of the user)
