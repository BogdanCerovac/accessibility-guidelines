## Summary

**If you give tips or instructions, don't assume that users can perceive colour, size, shape, sound or the location of elements on screen.**

Instructions must not depend on sensory characteristics like shape, size, colour, or location.

---

## Requirements

* Do not use shape, size, colour, or location to communicate instructions.

### Common mistakes

* An instruction tells users to “activate the green button”;
* An instruction tells users to “use the menu on the left of the page”;
* An instruction tells users they can “find more information in the square box”;
* An instruction tells users to “follow the biggest link in the tag cloud”.

### Why?

This ensures that instructions can be understood by users who are unable to see or recognise information communicated using sensory characteristics.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-understanding.html) Instructions provided for understanding and operating content do not rely solely on sensory characteristics of components such as shape, size, visual location, orientation, or sound. (Level A)

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-understanding.html) with techniques and examples.
