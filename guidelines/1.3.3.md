# Instructions don't rely on sensory characteristics

> If you give tips or instructions, don't assume that users can perceive colour, size, shape, sound or the location of elements on screen.

## What?

Instructions must not depend on sensory characteristics like shape, size, colour, or location.

### Requirements

* Do not use shape, size, colour, or location to communicate instructions.

### Official guidelines

* [1.3.3 Sensory characteristics (A) in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-understanding.html)

## Why?

This ensures that instructions can be understood by users who are unable to see or recognise information communicated using sensory characteristics.

## How?

### Design

#### Common mistakes

* An instruction tells users to “activate the green button”;
* An instruction tells users to “use the menu on the left of the page”;
* An instruction tells users they can “find more information in the square box”;
* An instruction tells users to “follow the biggest link in the tag cloud”.
