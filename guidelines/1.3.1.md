## Summary

**Make sure that structures and relationships that are conveyed visually (like distinct sections within a page, or a label next to a checkbox) are also identified in code.**

When content structures like tables, lists and headings are communicated visually, they must also be communicated in ways that assistive technologies can understand.

---

## Requirements

### Requirements for both native and web

* Headings are presented using the correct elements or properties in code;
* Form fields have properly associated labels;
* Form fields with format requirements or other additional information have properly associated hints

### Web only requirements

* Tabular data is presented using the correct markup
* Lists of items are presented using the correct markup
* Sets of radio buttons or checkboxes have a `<fieldset>` element to group them together, and a `<legend>` element to provide a label for the group

### Why?

This ensures that the structure of the content that's conveyed visually by the designs is also available to screen reader, screen magnifier and speech recognition tool users.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**1.3.1 Info and Relationships:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-programmatic.html) Information, [structure](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-programmatic.html#structuredef), and [relationships](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-programmatic.html#relationshipsdef) conveyed through [presentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-programmatic.html#presentationdef) can be [programmatically determined](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-programmatic.html#programmaticallydetermineddef) or are available in text. (Level A)

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-programmatic.html) with techniques and examples.

## Guidance for iOS

### Setting a view as a heading (e.g. table section headings or screen titles):

```swift
headingLabel.isAccessibilityElement = true
headingLabel.accessibilityTraits = [.heading]
```

### Setting a custom view as a search field:

```swift
customSearchField.isAccessibilityElement = true
customSearchField.accessibilityTraits = [.searchField]
```

### Setting a custom view as a tab bar:

```swift
customTabBar.isAccessibilityElement = true
customTabBar.accessibilityTraits = [.tabBar]
```

### You can combine traits if your element needs it:

```swift
view.accessibilityTraits = [.heading, .updatesFrequently]
```

### Providing a label for input fields:

```swift
textField.accessibilityLabel = "First Name"
```

## Guidance for Web

This section needs a review and more content. [Contribute or report issues via Github](https://github.com/theappbusiness/accessibility-guidelines/issues/59) (preferred) or [email](mailto:jeanfrancois@theappbusiness.com).

### Forming a correct headings structure

* Code headings with heading mark-up (`<h1> - <h6>`).
* Assign headings the correct heading level (i.e. the main page heading is coded with `<h1>`, its subheadings are coded with `<h2>`, subheadings of any `<h2>` heading are coded with `<h3>`, etc.).
* Text that does not represent a heading should not coded with heading mark-up.
  * Use CSS classes rather than `<h1> - <h6>` elements to style text that don't represent headings for sections of the page.

```html
<h1>Main heading for the page</h1>

<h2>Heading for the first top level section of the page</h2>
<h3>Heading for a sub-section, nested under the first top level section</h3>
<h4>Heading for a sub-sub-section, nested under that sub-section</h4>

<h2>Heading for the second top level section of the page</h2>
<h3>Heading for a sub-section, nested under the second top level section</h3>
```

#### More guidance on forming a correct headings structure

* [Headings tutorial](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/headings/) by the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative
* [Semantic structure](https://webaim.org/techniques/semanticstructure/) article by WebAIM

### Forming a data table

* A cell that is a row header should be coded with `<th scope="row">`;
* A cell that is a column header should be coded with `<th scope="col">`;
* Use `<th scope="rowgroup">` and `<th scope="colgroup">` if the same header applies to multiple rows or columns, but you should avoid complex tables like that as they are hard to understand for screen reader users;
* Cells containing data are coded with `<td>`.

* Complex data tables (i.e. tables containing several rows and/or columns of headers, irregular and multi-level headers) are avoided when possible.
  * When complex data tables must be used, each data cell is associated with all its headers via the `scope`, `id` and `headers` attributes.

* A title is provided for all data tables via the `<caption>` element (or `aria-labelledby` with the `id` of a `h1-h6` element directly introducing the table).

#### Example of a basic table structure

```html
<table>
	<caption>Short descriptive name for the table</caption>

	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th scope="col">Column Heading 1</th>
			<th scope="col">Column Heading 2</th>
			<th scope="col">Column Heading 3</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th scope="row">Row Heading 1</th>
			<td>Cell value for row 2, column 2</td>
			<td>Cell value for row 2, column 3</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<th scope="row">Row Heading 2</th>
			<td>Cell value for row 3, column 2</td>
			<td>Cell value for row 3, column 3</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
```

#### Do not use HTML tables for layout out content

* The use of layout tables (i.e. tables solely used to position items on the screen) should be avoided. Use CSS to position the content instead.
* When layout tables cannot be avoided, their source code should contain the ARIA `role="presentation"` attribute, and should not include the `<th>` and `<caption>` elements, and the `headers`, `axis`, `scope` and `summary` attributes.

* [Intentionally Hiding Semantics with the presentation Role](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#presentation_role) in the ARIA Authoring Practices Guide

### Forming lists

* Lists should be coded with the most appropriate HTML list element:
  * <ul> for unordered lists;
  * <ol> for ordered lists;
  * <dl> for description lists.

* List mark-up should be used to accurately describe the structure of lists.
  * For example, do not split items of a same list into two separate `<ul>` elements.

* Content that does not represent a list should not be coded with list mark-up.

#### Example of an ordered list

```html
<ol>
	<li>List value 1</li>
	<li>List value 2</li>
</ol>
```

#### Example of a description list

```html
<dl>
	<dt>Title 1</dt>
		<dd>List value 1</dd>
		<dd>List value 2</dd>
	<dt>Title 2</dt>
		<dd>List value 1</dd>
</dl>
```

#### More guidance on forming lists

### Associating form controls with labels, and associating related form controls

* Form fields that have a visible label should be associated with their label in the HTML code (via the `id` and `for` attributes).

```html
<label for='first-name'>First Name</label>
<input name='first-name' />
```

* Radio buttons and checkboxes are associated with their label via the `id` and `for` attributes, are grouped together with `<fieldset>` and the
question preceding each group is coded with `<legend>`.

#### Common mistakes

* Using the `placeholder` attribute to provide an ['Accessible Name'](./definitions.md#accessible-name) for a text `input` field. (The `placeholder` attribute is not well supported by some browsers and assistive technologies combinations, and shouldn't be used for labelling text fields).

### Identifying the page's landmark areas

* Identify the purpose of each section of content on a page via HTML5 semantic elements:
  * `<nav>` for the area containing navigation links
  * `<aside>` for content that complements the content in the `main` area, but would make sense on its own
  * `<footer>` for complementary information about the page (such as copyright)
  * `<banner>` for sections that are repeated across multiple pages at the top
  * `<main>` for the main content of the page (i.e. not header, navigation or footer elements or complementary content)
  * `<search>` for a component on the page that allows users to search content on the site

* When a same HMTL 5 element and/or ARIA landmark is used multiple times on a page, the content of each is described via `aria-label`. For example “main navigation”, “secondary navigation”.
