# Structure and relationships

> When designs convey a structure of information visually (like sections within a page, or a data table), that structure must also be identified in code so that screen readers can understand it.

## What?

When content structures like tables, lists and headings are communicated visually, they must also be communicated in ways that assistive technologies can understand.

### Requirements

* Headings are presented using the correct markup or traits;
* Form fields have properly associated labels;
* Form fields with format requirements or other additional information have properly associated hints;
* Tabular data is presented using the correct markup (web only);
* Lists of items are presented using the correct markup (web only);
* Sets of radio buttons or checkboxes have a `<fieldset>` element to group them together, and a `<legend>` element to provide a label for the group (web only).

### Official guidelines

* [1.3.1 "Info and Relationships" (A) in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-programmatic.html)

## Why?

This ensures that the structure of the content that is conveyed visually by the designs is also available to screen reader, screen magnifier and speech recognition tool users.

## How?

### iOS

Setting a view as a heading (e.g. table section headings or screen titles):

```swift
headingLabel.isAccessibilityElement = true
headingLabel.accessibilityTraits = [.heading]
```

Setting a custom view as a search field:

```swift
customSearchField.isAccessibilityElement = true
customSearchField.accessibilityTraits = [.searchField]
```

Setting a custom view as a tab bar:

```swift
customTabBar.isAccessibilityElement = true
customTabBar.accessibilityTraits = [.tabBar]
```

You can combine traits if your element needs it:

```swift
view.accessibilityTraits = [.heading, .updatesFrequently]
```

Providing a label for input fields:

```swift
textField.accessibilityLabel = "First Name"
```

```

### Web

Forming headers:

```html
<h1>Main title</h1>
<h2>Main subtitle</h2>
<h3>Content section title</h3>
<h4>Content section subtitle</h4>
```

Forming a table:

```html
<table summary="Summary of the table's contents">
	<tr>
		<th>Column Heading</th>
	</tr>
		<td>Column Value</td>
</table>
```

Forming an ordered list:

```html
<ol>
	<li>List value 1</li>
	<li>List value 2</li>
</ol>
```

Forming a definition list:

```html
<dl>
	<dt>Title 1</dt>
		<dd>List value 1</dd>
		<dd>List value 2</dd>
	<dt>Title 2</dt>
		<dd>List value 1</dd>
</dl>
```

Giving form fields associated labels:

```html
<label for='first-name'>First Name</label>
<input name='first-name' />
```
