## Summary

**Make sure that visual information that identifies important graphics, interactive controls and their state has enough contrast against adjacent colours.**

User Interface components and graphical objects must have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1.

---

## Requirements

### For user interface components

* Visual information required to identify user interface components (like the border or background of a text input field), and what state they're in (like focused, or in error), must have a 3:1 contrast ratio against adjacent colors.

  * Except for inactive components, or where the appearance of the component is determined by the Operating System/Web Browser, and not modified.

### For graphical objects (like icons, or parts of an infographics)

* Parts of graphics required to understand the content of a page must have a 3:1 contrast ratio against adjacent colors.

#### Common mistakes

* The purpose or ‘state’ of a control isn’t clear to the user.
* The purpose and meaning of important images that relate to page content - like if a medicine is poisonous, or other warnings - are hard to make out for a user who is sight impaired.

### Why?

Many sight impaired users cannot see important controls or understand graphics if they have poor colour contrast. 

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**1.4.11 Non-text Contrast (Level AA):**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-programmatic.html) The visual presentation of the following have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent color(s):
> 
> * **User Interface Components**: Visual information required to identify [user interface components](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html#dfn-user-interface-component) and [states](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html#dfn-state), except for inactive components or where the appearance of the component is determined by the user agent and not modified by the author;
> * **Graphical Objects**: Parts of graphics required to understand the content, except when a particular presentation of graphics is [essential](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html#dfn-essential) to the information being conveyed.

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-programmatic.html) with techniques and examples.

## Guidance for Design

* Check that buttons or other inputs and controls have a ratio of 3:1 or higher. This also includes their 'state'. 
  * This does not apply if inactive or if their look is made purely by the browser and not the author. 

* Make sure parts of any graphics required to understand the content (like a warning icon) have good colour contrast.
