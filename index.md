# Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Overview

This document will help you quickly get up to speed with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG), and avoid common mistakes people make when designing and developing both websites and native apps.

It gives a short description of the requirements you must meet to ensure that a website or app is accessible under the Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulation 2018, and to ensure clients meet their legal obligations under the 2010 Equality Act.

This short description is a simplification. If you're unsure about how to meet a requirement, check the [official Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).

### Principle 1: Perceivable
