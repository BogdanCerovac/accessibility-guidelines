* []():  

* [Order of elements in code](./guidelines/1.3.2.html): Make sure that elements appear in a logical reading order in code, so that they are presented in a meaningful order to screen reader users. <span class="badge badge--level-A"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span> <span class="badge badge--engineering"></span>

* [Instructions don't rely on sensory characteristics](./guidelines/1.3.3.html): When giving guidance or instructions, don't assume that users can perceive colour, size, shape, sound or the location of elements on screen. <span class="badge badge--level-A"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span>

* [Orientation](./guidelines/1.3.4.html): Make sure a page's view is not locked to either portrait or landscape mode, unless this is essential. <span class="badge badge--level-AA"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span> <span class="badge badge--engineering"></span>

* [Purpose of text fields](./guidelines/1.3.5.html): If a text input field collects information about the user, identify its specific purpose in code (e.g. email, password, street address). <span class="badge badge--level-AA"></span> <span class="badge badge--engineering"></span>

#### Make content easy for people to see and hear

* [Use of colour](./guidelines/1.4.1.html): Do not use colour as the only way to convey any piece of information. <span class="badge badge--level-A"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span>

* [Audio control](./guidelines/1.4.2.html): If any audio content plays automatically for more than three seconds, give people a way to stop it. <span class="badge badge--level-A"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span>

* [Text contrast](./guidelines/1.4.3.html): Make sure that text has enough contrast against the background colour. <span class="badge badge--level-AA"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span>

* [Non-text contrast](./guidelines/1.4.11.html): Make sure that visual information that identifies important graphics, interactive controls and their state has enough contrast against adjacent colours. <span class="badge badge--level-AA"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span>

* [Resize text](./guidelines/1.4.4.html): Make sure it is possible to complete all tasks when text is resized up to 200%. <span class="badge badge--level-AA"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span> <span class="badge badge--engineering"></span>

* [Reflow](./guidelines/1.4.10.html): Make sure users can access all information and functionality on a screen that's as wide as on the iPhone5, without needing to scroll in both directions. <span class="badge badge--level-AA"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span> <span class="badge badge--engineering"></span>

* [Text spacing](./guidelines/1.4.12.html): Ensure that no information or functionality gets lost if users increase the space between lines, paragraphs, letters and words. <span class="badge badge--level-AA"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span> <span class="badge badge--engineering"></span>

* [Images of text](./guidelines/1.4.5.html): Use real text rather than images of text. <span class="badge badge--level-AA"></span> <span class="badge badge--engineering"></span>

* [Extra content on hover or focus](./guidelines/1.4.13.html): If content (like a tooltip) appears when users hover over an element with their mouse (or tab to it with their keyboard), it must be easy to dismiss, easy to reach and remain visible. <span class="badge badge--level-AA"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span> <span class="badge badge--engineering"></span>

### 2. Easy to operate

Your website/app must be easy to navigate and use, no matter how someone interacts with it.

For example people who don't use a mouse may use their voice, or press the 'Tab' key to move their keyboard's focus to interactive controls.

#### Make all functionality work with a keyboard

* [Keyboard](): Make sure every task can be completed using just a keyboard. <span class="badge badge--level-A"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span> <span class="badge badge--engineering"></span>

* [No keyboard trap](): Make sure that keyboard-only users don't get trapped within any element. <span class="badge badge--level-A"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span> <span class="badge badge--engineering"></span>

* [Keyboard shortcuts](): If you've added custom keyboard shortcuts, provide a way to switch off or remap these shortcuts. <span class="badge badge--level-A"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span>

#### Make it work with other input methods beyond keyboard

* [Complex gestures](): Do not require complex gestures or using more than one finger to do things. <span class="badge badge--level-AA"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span>

* [Touch or click activation](): Make sure that custom buttons or links do not activate as soon as they are touched, so that users can slide their finger or mouse away to cancel the action. <span class="badge badge--level-AA"></span> <span class="badge badge--engineering"></span>

* [Label in name](): When an interactive control has a name on screen, make sure that assistive technologies (like Voice Control) know it by the same name (or a name that includes the name on screen). <span class="badge badge--level-AA"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span> <span class="badge badge--engineering"></span>

* [Device motion](): If a feature uses the device's motion (like shaking or tilting), make sure that responses to these motions can be turned off, and that the feature can be used in another way. <span class="badge badge--level-AA"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span> <span class="badge badge--engineering"></span>

#### Help people navigate and find content

* [Skip to main content](): Give keyboard and screen reader users a way to go directly to the page's main content. <span class="badge badge--web-only"></span> <span class="badge badge--level-A"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span>

* [Page titled](): Give every page a unique and helpful title that indicates the purpose of the page. <span class="badge badge--web-only"></span> <span class="badge badge--level-A"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span> <span class="badge badge--engineering"></span>

* [Focus order](): Make sure that interactive controls receive focus in an order that makes sense, when users navigate through them with the keyboard. <span class="badge badge--level-A"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span> <span class="badge badge--engineering"></span>

* [Link purpose](): Make sure the purpose of every link is clear from the link text alone, or together with associated content (if screen readers recognise the association). <span class="badge badge--level-A"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span> <span class="badge badge--engineering"></span>

* [Multiple ways to find a page](): Give people different ways of finding each page (like searching or browsing links), unless the page is a step in a process. <span class="badge badge--level-AA"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span>

* [Focus visible](): Make sure that keyboard-only users can clearly see which interactive control is focused when they tab through them. <span class="badge badge--level-AA"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span> <span class="badge badge--engineering"></span>

* [Heading and labels](): Provide headings and form labels that help people find content and complete tasks. <span class="badge badge--level-AA"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span>

#### Give people enough time to read and use content

* [Timing adjustable](): If there is any time limit (like a session timeout), give people an easy way to extend it. <span class="badge badge--level-A"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span>

* [Visual distractions](): Do not show anything that automatically blinks, scrolls, animates or updates frequently if it lasts more than 5 seconds. Or give people a way to stop it. <span class="badge badge--level-A"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span>

#### Do not cause seizures

* [Flashes](): Do not show anything that flashes more than three times a second. <span class="badge badge--level-A"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span> <span class="badge badge--content"></span>

### 3. Easy to understand

Your website/app must make it easy for people to understand information and how to complete tasks.

#### Make text easy to understand

* [Language of page](): In code, identify the language that the content of the page is written in (English for example). <span class="badge badge--level-A"></span> <span class="badge badge--content"></span> <span class="badge badge--engineering"></span>

* [Language of parts](): If the page has content in more than one language (for example, if a page in English has a button labelled in Welsh), identify the language of each part in code. <span class="badge badge--level-AA"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span> <span class="badge badge--content"></span> <span class="badge badge--engineering"></span>

#### Make things appear and behave in consistent, predictable ways

* [Changes on focus](): Make sure that just navigating to an interactive control with the keyboard doesn't trigger any action, and doesn't move the keyboard focus somewhere else. <span class="badge badge--level-A"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span>

* [Changes on input](): Make sure that just changing the state of a form input (like a checkbox) does not cause anything surprising to happen (like submitting a form, or automatically moving the keyboard focus). <span class="badge badge--level-A"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span>

* [Consistent navigation](): Make sure that navigation controls that appear on multiple pages (like links in a header) look and behave consistently. <span class="badge badge--level-AA"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span>

* [Consistent feature names](): If a user interface component exists on multiple pages, make sure that the way it looks and the way it is named is consistent across pages. <span class="badge badge--level-AA"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span>

#### Help people avoid and correct mistakes

* [Error identification](): When someone makes an error while filling a form, describe the error in text and clearly identify where the error is. <span class="badge badge--level-A"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span>

* [Form labels and instructions](): Provide labels to make it clear how users should fill a form, and optionally provide extra hints to help them avoid errors. <span class="badge badge--level-A"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span> <span class="badge badge--engineering"></span>

* [Error suggestions](): When someone makes an error while filling a form, give them suggestions on how to correct it. <span class="badge badge--level-AA"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span>

* [Error prevention (legal, financial, data)](): If users are making a legal commitment, a financial transaction, or updating personal data, give them a way to review and check the information they've entered before submitting it. <span class="badge badge--level-AA"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span>

---

### 4. Robust and compatible

Your website/app must work with different web browsers and/or assistive technologies.

* [Valid HTML](): Make sure the code of each page does not contain errors that are known to cause conflicts with assistive technologies (such as incorrect nesting of elements or duplicate ids). <span class="badge badge--web-only"></span> <span class="badge badge--level-A"></span> <span class="badge badge--engineering"></span>

* [Name, Role and State of interactive controls](): Make sure the code of each page enables assistive technologies to discover the purpose of every feature, the way that feature is identified, and the state it is currently in. <span class="badge badge--level-A"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span> <span class="badge badge--engineering"></span>

* [Status messages](): Make sure status messages are identified in code, so that assistive technologies can convey them to users. <span class="badge badge--level-AA"></span> <span class="badge badge--design"></span> <span class="badge badge--engineering"></span>
