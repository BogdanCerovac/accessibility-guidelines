# Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Summary

This document will help you quickly get up to speed with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG), and avoid common accessibility-related mistakes.

Click on each guideline to see details and code examples.

This summary is a simplification. If you're unsure about how to meet a requirement, check the [official Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).

### 1. Easy to perceive

Your website/app must present information in ways people can recognise and use, no matter how they consume content (for example if they have low vision or use a screen reader).

#### Provide text alternatives for images

* [Text alternatives for images](guidelines/1.1.1.md): Provide a text description for images. Make sure the description serves the same purpose as the image.

#### Provide alternatives for audio content, videos and presentations

* [Transcript for audio content](): Provide a transcript for audio content that has no video (like a podcast). The transcript must serve the same purpose as the original content.

* [Captions for videos and presentations](): Provide captions for videos and presentation, both live or pre-recorded. Include all dialogue and important sound-effects.

* [Text or audio description of videos and presentations](): Provide a text or audio description of videos or presentations. The description must serve the same purpose as the original content.

* [Audio description of pre-recorded videos or presentations](): If a video or presentation is prerecorded (rather than live), provide an audio description of the recording, even if you've already provided a text description.

#### Create content that can be presented in different ways

* [Structure and relationships:](guidelines/1.3.1.md) When designs convey a structure of information visually (like sections within a page, or a data table), that structure must also be identified in code so that screen readers can understand it.

* [Order of elements in code:](guidelines/1.3.2.md) Make sure that elements appear in a logical reading order in code, so that they are presented in a meaningful order to screen reader users.

* [Instructions don't rely on sensory characteristics:]() Do not use colour, size, shape, sound or location as the only way to convey any instruction.

* [Orientation:](guidelines/1.3.4.md) Make sure a page's view is not locked to either horizontal or vertical only, unless this is essential.

* [Purpose of text fields:]() If a text input field collects information about the user, identify its specific purpose in code (e.g. email, password, street address).

#### Make content easy for people to see and hear

* [Audio control:]() If any audio content plays automatically for more than three seconds, give people a way to stop it.

* [Use of colour:]() Do not use colour as the only way to convey information of any kind.

* [Text contrast:]() Make sure that text has enough contrast against the background colour.

* [Non-text contrast:]() Make sure that interactive controls (including visual elements that indicate their states) and important graphics have enough contrast against their adjacent colours.

* [Resize text:](guidelines/1.4.4.md) Make sure it is possible to complete all tasks when text is resized up to 200%.

* [Reflow:](guidelines/1.4.10.md) Make sure users can access all information and functionality on a screen that's as wide as on the iPhone5, without needing to scroll in both directions.

* [Text spacing:]() Ensure that no information or functionality gets lost if users increase the space between lines, paragraphs, letters and words.

* [Images of text:]() Use actual text rather than images of text.

* [Extra content on hover (or focus):]() If extra content (like tooltips or sub-menus) appear when users hover over an element (or move the keyboard focus to it), it must be easy to dismiss, easy to reach and remain visible.

### 2. Easy to operate

Your website/app must be navigable and usable no matter how someone uses it (without a mouse, with voice commands, or with a screen magnifier for example).

#### Make all functionality work with a keyboard

* [Keyboard:]() Make sure every task can be completed using just a keyboard.

* [No keyboard trap:]() Make sure that keyboard-only users don't get trapped within any element.

* [Keyboard shortcuts:]() If you've added custom keyboard shortcuts, provide a way to switch off or remap these shortcuts.

#### Make it work with other input methods beyond keyboard

* [Complex gestures:]() Do not require complex gestures or using more than one finger to do things.

* [Touch or click activation]() Make sure that custom buttons or links do not fire as soon as they are touched, so that users can cancel their action.

* [Accessibility name includes the visible name:]() When an interactive control has a visible name (like a button with text), make sure that its accessibility name matches (or at least includes) the name that is visible on the screen.

* [Device motion:]() If a feature uses the device's motion (like shaking or tilting), make sure that responses to these motions can be turned off, and that the feature can be used in another way.

#### Help people navigate and find content

* [Skip to main content:]() Give keyboard and screen reader users a way to go directly to the page's main content. [WEB ONLY]

* [Page titled:]() Give every page a unique and helpful `title` that indicates the purpose of the page. [WEB ONLY]

* [Heading and labels:]() Provide headings and form labels that will help people find content and complete tasks.

* [Focus order:]() Make sure that elements receive focus in an order that makes sense when people use a keyboard or a screen reader.

* [Focus visible:]() Make sure that keyboard-only users can clearly see which element has the keyboard focus on a page.

* [Link purpose:]() Make sure the purpose of every link is obvious from the link text alone (or the link text plus associated content â€“ if screen readers recognise the association).

* [Multiple ways to find a page]() Give people different ways of finding each page (like searching or browsing links), unless the page is a step in a process.

#### Give people enough time to read and use content

* [Timing adjustable:]() If there is any time limit (like a session timeout), give people an easy way to extend it.

* [Stop visual distractions:]() If any blinking, scrolling, animation or frequent updating happens automatically and last more than 5 seconds, give people a way to stop it.

#### Do not cause seizures

* [No three flashes:]() Do not show anything that flashes more than three times a second.

### 3. Easy to understand

Your website/app must make information understandable, and make it easy for people to understand how to complete tasks.

#### Make text easy to understand

* [Language of page:]() In code, identify the language that the content is written in. If the page uses several language, identify the language of each section.

#### Make things appear and behave in consistent, predictable ways

* [Changes on focus:]() Make sure that just navigating to a element using the keyboard doesn't trigger any important or disorientating change (like opening a pop up).

* [Changes on input:]() Make sure that just changing the state of a form input (like a dropdown menu) does not trigger any important or disorientating change.

* [Consistent navigation:]() Make sure that navigation elements that appear on multiple pages look and behave consistently.

* [Consistent feature names:]() Make sure that features that appear on multiple page are identified consistently.

#### Help people avoid and correct mistakes

* [Error identification:](): When someone makes a mistake, provide an error message in text and make it obvious where the mistake was made.

* [Form labels and instructions](): Provide form labels to make it clear what information is expected, and optionally provide extra hints to help people avoid mistakes.

* [Error suggestions:]() When someone makes a mistake give them suggestions on how to correct it, unless it compromises security.

* [Error prevention:]() If users are making a legal commitment, financial transaction, or updating personal data, give them a way to review and check the information they have entered.

### 4. Robust and compatible

Your website/app must work with different web browsers and/or assistive technologies.

* [Valid HTML:]() Make sure the code of each page does not contain errors that are known to cause conflicts. [WEB ONLY]

* [Name, Role and State of interactive controls:]() Make sure the code of each page enables assistive technologies to discover the purpose of every feature, the way that feature is identified, and the state it is currently in.

* [Status messages](): Make sure status messages are identified in code, so that assistive technologies can convey them to users.
